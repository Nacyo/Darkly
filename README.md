# Darkly
For obvious reasons, solutions to this project are not in this repository

## Objectives
* This project aims to introduce you to computer security in the field of the web.
* You will be able to discover OWASP, which is, more or less, the largest web security project to date.
* You will also understand what many frameworks do in an automated and completely transparent way for you.

## Instructions
* This project will only be corrected by humans.
* You may be required, during your defense, to prove your results. You have to prepare for it.
* You will need to use a virtual machine (i386) to validate this project. Once your machine is launched with the ISO provided with the subject, if everything is well configured, you will have a simple prompt with an IP.
* You only need to choose your browser to launch the displayed ip address.
* Your rendering folder should contain only the things that allowed you to resolve each exploited flaw.
* In the Resources folder you will put everything you need to prove your resolution in defense.
* If you need to use a specific file present on the ISO of the project, you must download it in defense. You must not under any circumstances put this one in your deposit.
* In the case of using specific external software, you must prepare a specific environment (VM, docker, Vagrant).
* WARNING: Everything that is present in your rendering folder must be explained clearly without any hesitation. NO binary should be present in this folder.
* As part of your mandatory game, you must complete 14 different flaws.
* During your defense, in some cases, you will be asked for possible fixes for the flaws you have exploited. It is therefore strongly advised to understand everything that you operate.
* Knowing how to explain is often more important than exploitation in itself: take the time to understand, and above all to make sure you can be understood clearly.
* Of course you do not have the right to use scripts sqlmap type in order to make the exploitation trivial. You must in any case clearly explain your approach during your defense.
